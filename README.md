# ML-Exercises

Finish the exercises by completing the code given

I'll be uploading solved examples with a Week#_Solved format, so you can cross check later if you want.

## Prerequisites
* You should be a little familiar with python, especially lists and for loops.
* Read the comments, they're there to help you out!

I'll include the modules required in each folder, but make sure you're running on **Python 3+** and you have pip installed.

Good luck :)
